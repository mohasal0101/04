## What is a â€˜Controlled Componentâ€™?
*a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state*

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
*To update in the user's browser without the need for server side process.*


## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

*The input event is fired every time the value of the element changes. This is unlike the change event, which only fires when the value is committed, such as by pressing the enter key, selecting a value from a list of options, and the like.* <br>
